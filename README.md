## Executive Pitch

Py-Tetris is a clone of the classic Tetris. Your objective is to create lines full of blocks
to eliminate them, you lose if a piece reaches the top row in the field.
What makes it unique is that you can buy powerups like changing the next piece, or
buying a 3-block piece replacing the next one. Using the amount of blocks destroyed as currency.

## Mechanics

- Tetris-like gameplay on the field part of the game
- Combo: Every time you complete a row or rows in success (subsequent moves)
you increase the combo bonus
- Currency: Every time you complete a row gain blocks as a reward based on your
combo and rows deleted
- You can buy powerups based on your current blocks
    - 3-block piece L/I
    - Change next piece
- Every time you bought one item it gets pricy
- Power-ups require a treshold before being available

## Story

You're fighting against the blocks by aligning them to destroy them and prevent overflow
